## Where to access this guide
You can access this guide either from it's web page on the [Teachability Website](http://www.teachability.eu) or via Jiscs website.

The guide is available in the following electronic formats:

* **Epub**: iBooks for iPhone, iPad and OSX
* **Mobi**: Amazon Kindle
* **HTML**: Web Browsers
* **Text**: Everything else.

The version on the Teachability website (http://teachability.eu/guides/location-based-activities-language-learning-micro-guide-educators/) is the canonical version. We will be updating this version with any additions or corrections before any of the other versions.

## What is this?
This guide is an experiment in [crowd sourced](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing) research and publishing. What your reading now is the first revision of what we hope will expand over time to include a number of different activities, reviews and general views and ideas about learning all contributed by a community of educators, learners, researchers and everyone in between. With luck--and your help--we aim to develop a resources that will contribute to the ongoing conversations on how we can use mobile technology in teaching and learning. Your contributions could be as simple as tidying up the source material through identifying spelling and grammar errors or as in-depth as designing and adding new material of your own such as new teaching activities or photography or graphics or even tutorial videos for others to learn from.

## How to contribute
Both Simon and I have started this guide, but we need you to help us complete it. Although perhaps *complete* isn't the right word here, we hope that this guide will never be completed, at least in any traditional sense. We hope that through your contributions this document can expand and adapt as mobile technology and the pedagogy that it supports it changes and evolves.

There are a few different ways you can contribute to this guide depending on *how* much you want to contribute and *what* you want to contribute.

If you want to draw our attention to a glaring spelling mistake or grammatical *faux-pas* then a short email to either or both of the authors would be appreciated.

# Plain Text?
I can imagine what your thinking--Why create a guide about plain text? And, perhaps more to the point--*what is plain text and why do I care about it?* In order to answer that question we have to reflect on how most of us in education currently create our teaching resources. In further and higher education, Information Technology forms the core of how we as students and educators interact with technology. Information Technology (or IT) is the result of many years of 

## Word Processors
Microsoft Word is so pervasive that we seldom even hear the term "Word Processor" now. Most of us just use 'Word' or at best 'Microsoft Word' if we are feeling pedantic. The Word Processor has evolved from a tool to help us design and write printed documents to a fully fledged Desktop Publishing tool. With that comes a great level of complexity. We have all seen those paper signs hung in shop windows, created using Words infamous and ironically titled "WordArt" feature. These documents have all the style of a ransom note. Oversized comic style fonts coupled with gaudy gradients may seem

>"When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail".
--Various

So goes the famous adage that hints at the human tendency to bend and shape things to what we know and understand. Applied to computers and software, many of us tend to rely on 

Now, I'm going to let you in to a secret--you don't actually need a Word Processor to create good looking documents. I'll say it again, just in case--you don't need a word processor. In fact, I would argue that all that interface just gets in the way of creating quality content. 

## A Typical Scenario
John--lets say he's a language teacher--wants to create a worksheet for his students. Obviously, his first port of call is Microsoft Word. He creates the worksheet, prints tweny of them off for his students. So far so good. 


# Markup -- An Introduction
Web pages are made using a simple kind of language--a mark-up language. This language describes *how* the document will look. For example when we want to make a word **bold** in Word we would first select the word using the mouse then use the bold button. In HTML we surround the word in the **bold** tag-- [<b>This will appear bold</b>].

As simple as HTML is it could be even simpler.

There are a few simplified mark-up languages such as Textastic (a few more examples here). However, the ironically named **Markdown** has emerged as a defacto standard.

## Markdown: An Overview
[John Gruber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber) is perhaps better known as the enigmatic host of [Daring Fireball](http://www.daringfireball.net) where he writes about [Apple](http://www.apple.com) technology amongst other things. However,


>Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible. Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like itâ€™s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

>To this end, Markdown's syntax is comprised entirely of punctuation characters, which punctuation characters have been carefully chosen so as to look like what they mean. E.g., asterisks around a word actually look like *emphasis*. Markdown lists look like, well, lists. Even block-quotes look like quoted passages of text, assuming you've ever used email.

The central intention of Markdown then is to not only allow writers a clean, simple and easy to remember inventory of

One of the advantages of Markdown is that it is readable as raw text. This means that the intention of the document should be clear even when viewed in a simple text editor. This clarity is largely due to the simple syntax used to describe the attributes of a document.

One of the key differences between using a word processor and using a markup language is that the mark-up language will need to be *compiled*. Meaning that before we can view the document in all it's marked-up glory we need to run the text file that you have written through a program that will produce a new document such as an HTML file viewable in a web browser or even a good old PDF

Markdown can be compiled in to a number of difference formats including PDF, HTML (for web pages) and even Word format.

In this section I'll cover the basic vocabulary of Markdown.

### Headings
Document headings are created using the *hash* symbol. Typing \# This is a heading will produce:

# This is a heading

This is often referred to as a first level heading and is often used for document titles. Second level heading are created using two hash symbols, one after the other \#\# followed by the title text.

	## This is a second level heading
When we compile the document, the output of this statement will look something like this:

## This is a second level heading

Third level heading are created using...you guessed it--three hash symbols. There are six heading levels in total. Each level is created using appropriate number of hash symbols followed by the title text and ended with a hard return.

	# First level heading
	## Second level heading
	### Third level heading
	#### Fourth level heading
	##### Fifth level heading
	###### Sixth level heading


## Emphasis--Bold, Underline and Italic
Creating **bold** text is as simple as surrounding the text you want to embolden with four asterisks "*". Two at the beginning of the string and two at the end:

	In this sentence **this text** will be bold.
In this sentence **this text** will be bold.

You can also use underscores in lieu of asterisks, meaning that:
	We can use two underscores __to make this text bold__.
We can use two underscores __to make this text bold__.

Text can be italicized in a similar fashion, this time using a single asterisk at the beginning of the string and one at the end.

	In this sentence *this text* will be italicized.
In this sentence *this text* will be italicized.

Again, we can use underscores "_" instead of asterisks here.

	In this sentence _this text_ will be italicized.
In this sentence _this text_ will be italicized.

It depends on which you prefer, underscores or asterisks, the choice is yours and the results are the same.

## Lists: Numbered and Bulleted

Vertical lists--sometimes called *display" lists--are used to present thematically related information in a more concise fashion than would be normally expected in a long-form document.

There are two types of vertical lists used in modern electronic documents--ordered (numerical) and unordered(bulleted).

Ordered, numerical lists are generally used when you want to present information where the sequence is important. Creating ordered lists in **Markdown** is as simple as precluding each list entry with a numeric digit followed by a period.

	1. This is the first item in the list
	2. And this is the second
	3. Yep, this is the third

We can create *bulleted* lists by placing a either an asterisk (*****), plus symbol (**+**) or minus symbol (**-**) in front of each list item.

	* This is the first item in a bulleted list
	* This is the second

	- We can use minus symbols to create lists too
	+ The plus sign will also work.

We can create nested lists (lists within lists) by indenting (using the TAB key) followed by either a number or one of the bullet symbols.

	1. This is a numbered list
		* This is the first element of a nested list.
		* This is the second element of a nested list
	2. Now we are back in the main list

## Web Links
One of the great things about Markdown is that you can compile your text file in to any number of other formats. Simplifying HTML was the original purpose of **Markdown** and compiling to HTML remains its most common purpose. As such, embedding web-links within your documents is something you will no doubt be relying on.

**Markdown** supports a number of hyperlink styles. The simplest of which is known as the *inline-style* and is created  made up of a

	[This link will take you to Google.com](http://www.google.com)

You can also include a title at the end of the link text that will help describe the purpose of the link itself. When viewing your web page, the user will be able to put their mouse over the link and see this extra text as a pop-up.

	[This link will take you to Google.com](http://www.google.com "Google Homepage")

Will give you this when viewed as a web page. *Note the popup at the bottom.*
![Link with title](./images/link_with_title.png)

As you write your document and the links mount up you may find that overall readability is compromised. Links are a generally messy affair to have littered around your document. This is especially true of you have extra long links such as the one highlighted below.

	[Google Docs](http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&c
	d=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCIQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.co.uk%2Fdocs%2
	Fabout%2F&ei=HdHwVLWYEYn4UOiGgtgK&usg=AFQjCNHfCVygFhDAdU_o9PlVXsI881bJ3w&si
	g2=yeBGCUbfprGHpHF-K4LUPQ&bvm=bv.87269000,d.d24)

Thankfully, you can tidy things up a bit by using *reference style* links. Instead of hard coding the link text (e.g. www.google.com) directly within the text body you create a named reference that you can put at the end of your document. This is particularly handy if you have a lot of links in your document.

	[This is a reference style link][some link name]

	<--- at the end of your document --->
	[some link name]: http://www.google.com

You can also use numbers for reference style links. The reason for this might not be immediately apparent until you remember that **Markdown** is intended to be as readable in plain text as it is in any other format such as HTML or PDF.

	[This is a reference style link with numbers][1]

	<--- at the end of your document --->
	[1]: http://www.google.com

##Images
If you have used [Microsoft Word](http://products.office.com/en-us/word) or another word processor like the ubiquitous [Google Docs](http://www.google.co.uk/docs/about/) then you may have dropped an image or two in to your documents. Word is notorious for including a wealth of *clipart* imagary, most of questionable quality. The ease at which we can now include images within our worf processed documents has led to an explosion of headache inducing documents from
