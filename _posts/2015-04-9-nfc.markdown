# An Introduction to Physical Computing

An Introduction to Physical Computing by Thomas Sweeney and Simon Wardman is licensed under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/" rel="license">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>.


## Where to access this guide
You can access this guide either from it's web page on the [Teachability Website](http://www.teachability.eu) or via Jiscs website.

The guide is available in the following electronic formats:

* **Epub**: iBooks for iPhone, iPad and OSX
* **Mobi**: Amazon Kindle
* **HTML**: Web Browsers
* **Text**: Everything else.

The version on the Teachability website (http://teachability.eu/guides/location-based-activities-language-learning-micro-guide-educators/) is the canonical version. We will be updating this version with any additions or corrections before any of the other versions.

## What is this?
This guide is an experiment in [crowd sourced](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing) research and publishing. What your reading now is the first revision of what we hope will expand over time to include a number of different activities, reviews and general views and ideas about learning all contributed by a community of educators, learners, researchers and everyone in between. With luck--and your help--we aim to develop a resources that will contribute to the ongoing conversations on how we can use mobile technology in teaching and learning. Your contributions could be as simple as tidying up the source material through identifying spelling and grammar errors or as in-depth as designing and adding new material of your own such as new teaching activities or photography or graphics or even tutorial videos for others to learn from.

## How to contribute
Both Simon and I have started this guide, but we need you to help us complete it. Although perhaps *complete* isn't the right word here, we hope that this guide will never be completed, at least in any traditional sense. We hope that through your contributions this document can expand and adapt as mobile technology and the pedagogy that it supports it changes and evolves.

There are a few different ways you can contribute to this guide depending on *how* much you want to contribute and *what* you want to contribute.

If you want to draw our attention to a glaring spelling mistake or grammatical *faux-pas* then a short email to either or both of the authors would be appreciated.

If you are looking to contribute something more substantial such as an article, photography or a video then feel free to contact us using any of the methods listed below.

# Physical Computing and The Internet of Things Once upon a time there
was a computer. This computer sat on a desk under the stairs in its
family's home. Over the next few years the computer ventured out,
further in to the family home, sitting in the laps of children,
helping them with their home work and chatting. They

Since the dawn of computer science one of the essential goals of the
discipline is to create a world where technology is both ubiquitous
and hidden.

#NFC 
Near Field Communication is an emerging standard. It's a funny
technology in so much as it doesnt really have a purpose as of yet. Despite
backing from some of the worlds biggest and brightest technology
companies including Philips and Intel

We recognise that many of you simply don't have the time to engage
with new technologies as they appear and we certainly don't aim these
guides at any one other than the casual observer. With this in mind we see this guide as a*very* gentle introduction to using NFC tags.
