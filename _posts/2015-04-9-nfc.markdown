## Where to access this guide
You can access this guide either from it's web page on the [Teachability Website](http://www.teachability.eu) or via Jiscs website.

The guide is available in the following electronic formats:

* **Epub**: iBooks for iPhone, iPad and OSX
* **Mobi**: Amazon Kindle
* **HTML**: Web Browsers
* **Text**: Everything else.

The version on the Teachability website (http://teachability.eu/guides/location-based-activities-language-learning-micro-guide-educators/) is the canonical version. We will be updating this version with any additions or corrections before any of the other versions.

## What is this?
This guide is an experiment in [crowd sourced](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing) research and publishing. What your reading now is the first revision of what we hope will expand over time to include a number of different activities, reviews and general views and ideas about learning all contributed by a community of educators, learners, researchers and everyone in between. With luck--and your help--we aim to develop a resources that will contribute to the ongoing conversations on how we can use mobile technology in teaching and learning. Your contributions could be as simple as tidying up the source material through identifying spelling and grammar errors or as in-depth as designing and adding new material of your own such as new teaching activities or photography or graphics or even tutorial videos for others to learn from.

## How to contribute
Both Simon and I have started this guide, but we need you to help us complete it. Although perhaps *complete* isn't the right word here, we hope that this guide will never be completed, at least in any traditional sense. We hope that through your contributions this document can expand and adapt as mobile technology and the pedagogy that it supports it changes and evolves.

There are a few different ways you can contribute to this guide depending on *how* much you want to contribute and *what* you want to contribute.

If you want to draw our attention to a glaring spelling mistake or grammatical *faux-pas* then a short email to either or both of the authors would be appreciated.

If you are looking to contribute something more substantial such as an article, photography or a video then feel free to contact us using any of the methods listed below.

### Sending an Email
Comments, corrections and complaints can be sent to either [Thomas Sweeney ](mailto:tommy@teachability.eu) or [Simon Wardman](mailto:simon@teachability.eu).

However, we are equally as anxious to hear about any potential improvements or corrections.

# Physical Computing and The Internet of Things 
Once upon a time there was a computer. This computer sat on an old desk, under the main stairs of its
family's home. Over the next few years the computer ventured out,
further in to the family home, sitting in the laps of children,
helping them with their home work and chatting. They

Since the dawn of computer science one of the essential goals of the
discipline is to create a world where technology is both ubiquitous
and hidden.

# NFC 
Near Field Communication is an emerging standard that allows devices to. It's a funny
technology in so much as it doesnt really have a purpose as of yet. Despite
backing from some of the worlds biggest and brightest technology
companies including Philips and Intel. 

We recognise that many of you simply don't have the time to engage
with new technologies as they appear and we certainly don't aim these
guides at any one other than the casual observer. With this in mind we see this guide as a*very* gentle introduction to using NFC technology. Don’t worry of you feel a bit overwhelemed by some of the jargon, using the technology itself is actually very simple.


# Recipes and Tips
Simon Wardman (one of the authors of this guide) has been using NFC technology in his English language classes for the last few years. Here, he shares some of his ideas on how to integrate NFC technology in to teaching and learning.

## Make life easy

Make life easy by bringing the web a more tangible aspect of your learning spaces. NFC tags make it simpler to exchange digital content and connect electronic devices with a touch. The student homepage provides official, up-to-date, college information. Students should know how to access the college’s homepage and be able to access it on a regular basis outside the college. An NFC tag facilitates rapid mobile access to student information, news and events from a variety of areas of the College including Student Finance, Learner Involvement, EDI, Sport Volunteering. The student homepage will also provide help and support and provide links to key learning application.

## Bridge the gap between experts and learners
![Making life easy using NFC tags](/assets/images/physical/tip2.jpg)

Narrow the distance between experts and new learners by linking short video profiles to the photos creating a useful bridge between the physical and digital learning environments.

## Out of hours support
![Making life easy using NFC tags](/assets/images/physical/tip3.jpg)

NFC tags can be used at reception or when college facilities are closed. Tags could refer students to online help, a welcome video or even connect them directly to helpline support.

## College rules and regulations
![Making life easy using NFC tags](/assets/images/physical/tip4.jpg)

College posters can be linked to college online policy statements and strategy documents to supply students with additional information.

## Understand the students needs
![Making life easy using NFC tags](/assets/images/physical/tip5.jpg)

NFC posters can provide an easy way to link to online questionnaires and feedback forms. Hardcopies of questionnaires should always be available if students have difficulty with connectivity or lack of Wi-Fi. NFC tags can even be incorporated in to the hardcopies themselves, providing a fun way for students to engage with an often tiresome task.

## NFC tags can support collaborative and social learning
![Making life easy using NFC tags](/assets/images/physical/tip6.jpg)

The fundamental role of the teacher is not to transmit information but to guide the social process of learning. Out of classroom activities using NFC posters are a great way to support this.

## Use contactless technology for access control
![Making life easy using NFC tags](/assets/images/physical/tip7.jpg)

Central College has chosen contactless technology for their solution to access control. Credentials may also be sent to smartphones as soon as an ID card is issued. This could save money by cutting down on printing cards.

## Promote professional development events and networking
![Making life easy using NFC tags](/assets/images/physical/tip8.jpg)

Teachers need areas online to discuss and debate educational issues. NFC tags can promotes access to online subject specific forums or educational networking groups.

## Make the most of existing online learning resources and the institution’s VLE
![Making life easy using NFC tags](/assets/images/physical/tip9.jpg)

Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) are used by many colleges but unfortunately many students aren’t getting the most from their platform. Make sure the administrators have optimized the VLE for mobile devices and insist that the IT department allow students to use their own email, so that they can receive peer notifications via the VLE. This will help keep students engaged with the resources and collaborative activates. Make certain an NFC poster directs students to the learning resources and facilitates the logging in process.

##Link physical noticeboards to digital ones
![Making life easy using NFC tags](/assets/images/physical/tip10.jpg)

A physical Student noticeboard provides a focus for students when they leave their classrooms and can lists opportunities and information of direct interest to students.
When physical noticeboards are linked by NFC to online forums and noticeboards, students can become part of a discussion and can share their own news, views and announcements.
NFC technology works at close distances and can be used behind lockable noticeboards and the other side of clear plastic or glass without any problems. It is difficult to read NFC tags unintentionally as they only have a range of a few centimetres. NFC tags can be put on any poster placed around the college and on almost anything to provided added guidance or information.
