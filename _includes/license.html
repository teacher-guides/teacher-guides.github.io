<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>This guide is an experiment in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing" alt="Wikipedia article on Crowd Sourcing">crowd sourced</a> research and publishing. What your reading now is the first revision of what we hope will expand over time to include a number of different activities, reviews and general views and ideas about learning all contributed by a community of educators, learners, researchers and everyone in between. With luck--and your help--we aim to develop a resources that will contribute to the ongoing conversations on how we can use mobile technology in teaching and learning. Your contributions could be as simple as tidying up the source material through identifying spelling and grammar errors or as in-depth as designing and adding new material of your own such as new teaching activities or photography or graphics or even tutorial videos for others to learn from.</p>

<h2>How to contribute</h2>
<p>Both Simon and I have started this guide, but we need you to help us complete it. Although perhaps *complete* isn't the right word here, we hope that this guide will never be completed, at least in any traditional sense. We hope that through your contributions this document can expand and adapt as mobile technology and the pedagogy that it supports it changes and evolves.</p>
